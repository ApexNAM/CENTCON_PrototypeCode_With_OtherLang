# Project CENTCON 
The CENTCON project is a turn-based arena shooting dice game that abstracts arena shooting games \
such as Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament (1999) in the form of dice and tiles, based on the concept of Defcon.

Currently, this project is undergoing a paper prototype and game design \
process as of late October to November 2022, and full-scale development is planned in 2023.

The game deadline is set for December 2023.
